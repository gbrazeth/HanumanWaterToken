      },
      "risks": {
        "question": "What are the main risks of investing in HWT?",
        "answer": "1. Identification and Risk Factors\n\n1.1 Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nThe regulatory environment for virtual assets is constantly evolving, both in Brazil and in relevant international jurisdictions. There is substantial risk that regulatory authorities, including CVM, BACEN or international bodies, may classify HWT differently than intended by the issuer, potentially as a security subject to a more restrictive regulatory regime.\nChanges in legislation applicable to crypto assets, personal data protection, consumer rights or water resource management may negatively impact the operational viability of the project or impose significant additional compliance costs. Additionally, there is the possibility of legal disputes arising related to intellectual property, interpretation of contractual terms, token holder rights or environmental liability.\n\n1.2 Operational Risks and Underlying Asset\nAlthough technical studies indicate stability of the source characteristics, there is inherent risk of future variations in flow, temperature or water quality due to geological, climatic or environmental factors beyond the company's control. Such variations may affect production capacity or final product quality.\nThe implementation and operation of the bottling plant, as well as the establishment of an efficient supply chain and adequate distribution logistics for redemption fulfillment, present significant operational challenges. Unexpected increases in energy, maintenance, transportation, labor or regulatory compliance costs may negatively impact the project's economic viability.\n\n1.3 Technological and Cybersecurity Risks\nThe use of blockchain technology and smart contracts, while offering advantages in terms of transparency and automation, exposes the project to specific technological risks. Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts may result in token losses, malfunction of programmed utilities or exposure to malicious attacks.\nRisks inherent to the chosen blockchain platform, including network congestion, transaction fee volatility, 51% attacks or other forms of security compromise, may affect the system's functionality and reliability. Additionally, cyberattacks targeting the sales platform, digital wallet systems or the project's technological infrastructure represent constant threats.\n\n1.4 Market and Project Execution Risks\nThe acceptance of the tokenized mineral water concept by the consumer market remains uncertain, potentially affecting demand for the product and, consequently, the token's utility.\nDelays or failures in executing the planned roadmap, including obtaining licenses, infrastructure construction or technological development, may compromise the project's viability. Inadequate management of financial resources raised from token sales represents an additional risk to the enterprise's sustainability.\n\n1.5 Jurisdictional Restrictions and Geographic Limitations\nThe offer and commercialization of HWT may be subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions, depending on local legislation applicable to crypto assets, digital tokens and securities offerings. It is the exclusive responsibility of each potential acquirer to verify the legality of acquiring and holding HWT in their country of residence or domicile jurisdiction.\nHanuman Minas Ltda. reserves the right to restrict or prohibit participation of residents of certain jurisdictions in acquiring HWT, especially those where such participation may constitute violation of local laws or expose the company to unacceptable regulatory risks.\n\n1.6 Identification and Analysis of Risk Factors\n\n1.6.1 Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nThe regulatory environment for virtual assets is constantly evolving, both in Brazil and in relevant international jurisdictions. There is substantial risk that regulatory authorities, including CVM, BACEN or international bodies, may classify HWT differently than intended by the issuer, potentially as a security subject to a more restrictive regulatory regime.\nChanges in legislation applicable to crypto assets, personal data protection, consumer rights or water resource management may negatively impact the operational viability of the project or impose significant additional compliance costs. Additionally, there is the possibility of legal disputes arising related to intellectual property, interpretation of contractual terms, token holder rights or environmental liability.\n\n1.6.2 Operational Risks and Underlying Asset\nAlthough technical studies indicate stability of the source characteristics, there is inherent risk of future variations in flow, temperature or water quality due to geological, climatic or environmental factors beyond the company's control. Such variations may affect production capacity or final product quality.\nThe implementation and operation of the bottling plant, as well as the establishment of an efficient supply chain and adequate distribution logistics for redemption fulfillment, present significant operational challenges. Unexpected increases in energy, maintenance, transportation, labor or regulatory compliance costs may negatively impact the project's economic viability.\n\n1.6.3 Technological and Cybersecurity Risks\nThe use of blockchain technology and smart contracts, while offering advantages in terms of transparency and automation, exposes the project to specific technological risks. Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts may result in token losses, malfunction of programmed utilities or exposure to malicious attacks.\nRisks inherent to the chosen blockchain platform, including network congestion, transaction fee volatility, 51% attacks or other forms of security compromise, may affect the system's functionality and reliability. Additionally, cyberattacks targeting the sales platform, digital wallet systems or the project's technological infrastructure represent constant threats.\n\n1.6.4 Market and Project Execution Risks\nThe acceptance of the tokenized mineral water concept by the consumer market remains uncertain, potentially affecting demand for the product and, consequently, the token's utility.\nDelays or failures in executing the planned roadmap, including obtaining licenses, infrastructure construction or technological development, may compromise the project's viability. Inadequate management of financial resources raised from token sales represents an additional risk to the enterprise's sustainability.\n\n1.7 Legal Notices and Mandatory Disclaimers\n\n1.7.1 Investment Risk Notice\nHWT constitutes a risky utility token. It does not represent a financial investment, equity participation in Hanuman Minas Ltda. or right to income of any nature.\n\n1.7.2 Advisory Disclaimer\nThis document and any materials associated with HWT do not constitute a securities offering, investment recommendation, financial, legal, tax or any other nature advice. Potential acquirers should conduct independent analysis and consult qualified professionals before making decisions related to HWT.\n\n1.7.3 Jurisdictional Limitations\nThe offer and sale of HWT may be restricted or prohibited in certain jurisdictions. It is the exclusive responsibility of the acquirer to verify the legality of acquisition in their country of residence. The project is not intended for individuals or legal entities located in jurisdictions where its offer is considered illegal.\n\n1.7.4 Operational Dependencies and Conditions for Exercise of Redemption Right\nThe project's success and effective capacity to redeem mineral water depend on multiple operational, logistical, technological and regulatory factors, all subject to risks and uncertainties. The project, its execution timeline and operational terms may undergo substantial changes or even become unfeasible."

      "redemption": {
        "question": "When and how can I redeem the physical water corresponding to my HWT tokens?",
        "answer": "The forecast for the start of the possibility of redeeming physical water is from the end of 2028, with the operations of the bottling factory near the Hanuman Source, in the municipality of Niquelândia. The exact details about the redemption process, logistics, shipping costs (if applicable) and collection locations or methods will be officially communicated as the project advances to this phase.\nThe order of preference for water redemption follows the chronology of public purchase of the token originally on the Hanuman Water Token Platform. The redemption request must be made with a minimum advance notice of 90 (ninety) days. Purchases of HWT made in the pre-sale phase can request redemption with a minimum notice of 30 (thirty) days. All deliveries will follow the capacity and physical administrative and regulatory operations determined for the production of the Source."
      },
      "minPurchase": {
        "question": "What is the minimum amount of HWT I can buy?",
        "answer": "During the pre-sale phase, the minimum quantity for purchase is 10 tokens per transaction. However, only with 100 HWT tokens will you be able to receive the water. For more details on how to buy, visit our checkout section or contact our support."
      },
      "sustainability": {
        "question": "How does the HanumanWaterToken project deal with the sustainability of the Hanuman Source?",
        "answer": "The HWT project was structured based on rigorous scientific and technological foundations to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Hanuman Source, combining environmental conservation, social responsibility and technological innovation.\n\n1. Proven Scientific Foundations\n• University studies conducted by the Institute of Geosciences of the University of Brasília (IG-UnB), published in the Elsevier journal \"Groundwater Sustainable and Development\" (2022).\n• Annual Exploitable Reserve (RExA): 3.77 million m³/year, establishing conservative limits for sustainable extraction.\n• Permanent Total Reserve: 75.4 million m³, ensuring availability for future generations.\n\n2.

      },
      "earlyRedemption": {
        "question": "How can I redeem HWT before the start of operations of the Hanuman Source bottling industry in Niquelândia?",
        "answer": "Although the complete bottling operation is scheduled for the end of 2028, there is the possibility of early redemption of HWT if ANM grants authorization for commercial exploitation of water from Hanuman Source I (ANM process no. 860/360/2017) through a Utilization Guide (GU).\n\nThe Utilization Guide is a common regulatory instrument in the mining sector, allowing commercial exploitation of mineral resources before the definitive granting of the Mining Permit, being used to minimize research costs. However, mineral and thermal waters are not currently on the list of minerals authorized for GU. Therefore, Hanuman Minas Ltda filed a specific request with ANM for analysis of the Hanuman Water case, highlighting its multifunctionality and potential to boost productive arrangements and services in Chapada dos Veadeiros.\n\nIf the request is approved, HWT holders will be able to request early redemption of water for use as raw material in:\n• Production of cosmeceuticals and dermocosmetics\n• Production of functional beverages (kombucha, natural juices, craft beers, gourmet coffees)\n• Supply for restaurants and haute cuisine\n• External use products and therapeutic applications\n\nRequest Process: Official announcements about ANM authorization and opening of the redemption request period will be published on our official channels.\n\nImportant: Mineral exploitation by Utilization Guide will always be conditioned to compliance with all licenses and meeting all applicable technical and sanitary requirements."
      },
      "transparency": {
        "question": "What is the commitment to transparency, governance and communication?",
        "answer": "1. Information Transparency\nHanuman Minas Ltda. commits to providing clear, accurate and complete information about HWT, mineral source operations, terms of use and risks involved, always using accessible language and in compliance with the Consumer Protection Code and best market practices.\n\n2. Continuous Regulatory Monitoring\nRecognizing the dynamic nature of the regulatory environment for virtual assets, the company will maintain active monitoring of legislative and regulatory changes in Brazil and other relevant jurisdictions, adapting its operational practices whenever necessary to ensure maintenance of compliance.\n\n3. Stakeholder Communication\nAppropriate communication channels will be established to keep token holders informed about significant project developments, relevant regulatory changes and any circumstances that may affect their rights or the viability of the enterprise."
